The threed-garden package on npm is a JavaScript library designed to help developers create and manage 3D gardens or landscapes in web applications. It leverages WebGL or other 3D rendering technologies to render 3D plants, trees, and other garden elements in a browser environment. This library is particularly useful for creating interactive 3D visualizations, simulations, or games involving natural environments.
Key Features:

    3D Plant Rendering:

        The library provides tools to render various types of plants, trees, and shrubs in 3D.

        It may include customizable parameters for plant size, shape, color, and growth stages.

    Interactive Garden Design:

        Users can interactively design and modify gardens by adding, removing, or rearranging plants.

        It may support drag-and-drop functionality for placing plants in the 3D space.

    Realistic Environment Simulation:

        The library might include features to simulate environmental factors like sunlight, water, and soil conditions, affecting plant growth and appearance.

    Cross-Browser Compatibility:

        Built using WebGL or similar technologies, it ensures compatibility across modern web browsers.

    Customizable and Extendable:

        Developers can extend the library to add custom plants, textures, or environmental effects.

        It may support plugins or integrations with other 3D libraries like Three.js.

    Lightweight and Performant:

        Optimized for performance to ensure smooth rendering even with complex garden designs.

Use Cases:

    Educational Tools: Teaching about botany, ecology, or sustainable gardening practices.

    Gaming: Creating immersive 3D environments for games.

    Architectural Visualization: Designing landscapes for architectural projects.

    E-commerce: Allowing customers to visualize how plants will look in their gardens.

Installation:

You can install the library via npm:
bash
Copy

npm install threed-garden

Basic Usage Example:

Here’s a simple example of how you might use threed-garden to create a basic 3D garden:
javascript
Copy

import { Garden, Plant } from 'threed-garden';

// Initialize a garden scene
const garden = new Garden({ container: '#garden-container' });

// Add a plant to the garden
const rose = new Plant({ type: 'rose', position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } });
garden.addPlant(rose);

// Render the garden
garden.render();
